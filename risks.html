        <article class="card reveal"><h3>1. Cardiovascular disease</h3><p>Type 2 diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and coronary artery disease. Chronically high blood glucose damages blood vessels and accelerates atherosclerosis (plaque buildup), making cardiovascular disease the leading cause of death among people with diabetes.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>2. Kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy)</h3><p>Persistently high blood sugar damages the small blood vessels in the kidneys, reducing their ability to filter waste. Over time, this can lead to chronic kidney disease and, in severe cases, kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>3. Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy)</h3><p>High glucose levels can injure nerves, particularly in the legs and feet. This may cause pain, tingling, numbness, or loss of sensation, increasing the risk of unnoticed injuries and infections.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>4. Foot complications and amputations</h3><p>Reduced blood flow and nerve damage raise the risk of foot ulcers and infections. Poor wound healing means minor injuries can become severe, sometimes leading to partial or full limb amputation.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>5. Eye disease (diabetic retinopathy)</h3><p>Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, leading to vision impairment and blindness. It also increases the risk of cataracts and glaucoma.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>6. Increased susceptibility to infections</h3><p>High blood sugar weakens immune function, making infections (such as skin, urinary tract, and gum infections) more frequent and harder to treat.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>7. Sexual and reproductive health issues</h3><p>Diabetes can contribute to erectile dysfunction in men and reduced sexual function in women, largely due to nerve and blood vessel damage.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>8. Cognitive decline and dementia risk</h3><p>Evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment and forms of dementia, possibly due to vascular damage and chronic inflammation.</p></article>
        <article class="card reveal"><h3>9. Mental health effects</h3><p>Living with diabetes is associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and diabetes-related distress, which can also worsen blood-glucose control.</p></article>
